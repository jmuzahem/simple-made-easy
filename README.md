## Overview

Simple is not the same as easy.

- Simple → clean, untangled, one idea at a time  
- Easy → familiar; feels quick because you've done it before  

We often choose easy now, which leads to complexity later.

## 1. Simple vs Easy

| Concept | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Simple | Not tangled, focused, atomic |
| Easy   | Familiar, convenient, quick right now |

Simplicity is not the same as ease.

---

## 2. Where Complexity Comes From

Complexity increases when we mix:

- ideas  
- data  
- logic  
- state  

When these are tangled, systems become confusing.

---

## 3. Why Simplicity Helps

Simple systems are:

- easier to understand  
- easier to fix  
- easier to change  
- more reliable  

You can trust what you can understand.

---

## 4. How to Keep Things Simple

Guidance from Rich Hickey:

1. Use immutable data  
2. Use pure functions (same input → same output)  
3. Separate data from behavior  
4. Use declarative style (describe what, not how)  
5. Build small components that fit together cleanly  

---

## 5. Choose Tools for the Result

Do not choose the tool that feels easy.  
Choose the tool that makes the final system simple.

---

## 6. Simplicity Takes Effort

Simplicity takes thought up front,  
but saves enormous effort later.

---

## One Sentence Summary

Choose simple, not easy — your future self will thank you.

# Examples

## Support Engineer Example

**Easy:**  
Restart the server every time it breaks.

**Simple:**  
Find and fix the root cause.

**Lesson:**

---

## Organizing Files Example

**Easy:**  
Put everything on the desktop.

**Simple:**  
Use three folders: `Work/`, `Personal/`, `Archive/`.

**Lesson:**  
Easy now becomes messy later.  
Simple stays clean.
